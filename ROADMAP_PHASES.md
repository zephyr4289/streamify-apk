# ROADMAP_PHASES.md — 4-Phase Concurrent Engineering Plan (27 Spotify Gaps)

> **Core Objective:** Build a completely ad-free, bloat-free, music-first daily driver with all extreme features Spotify and YouTube Music provide (via high-performance reverse engineering, scraping, and serverless P2P mesh).
>
> **Execution Model:** Work across **4 sequential phases**. Within each phase, **all 3 engineers work concurrently** on strictly decoupled sub-modules (`native/`, `rust/`, `app/`) with frozen ABIs and independent CI verification.
