//! gossip.rs — PlumTree Epidemic Broadcast Trees for the Jam mesh (Phase 2).
//!
//! Push-Lazy-Push multicast (Leitão, Pereira & Rodrigues, SRDS'07), adapted
//! for the Streamify wire format:
//!
//!   Eager push  — every new frame is forwarded immediately along the eager
//!                 tree edges: mutations (JamOpWire), PTP ticks and track
//!                 manifests land with one-hop latency.
//!   Lazy tree   — peers outside the eager tree get compact IHAVE
//!                 announcements (message-id batches) on [`GossipParams::
//!                 lazy_tick`]; if an eager copy was lost to Wi-Fi jitter,
//!                 the missing peer GRAFTs the announcer, which reinstates
//!                 the eager link and re-serves the payload.
//!   Pruning     — receiving an eager frame we already have means the link
//!                 is redundant; once the stream has gone QUIET, a few
//!                 redundant deliveries demote the sender to the lazy set
//!                 (hysteresis default 2). During bursts pruning is
//!                 suppressed: full-mesh eager redundancy is the loss
//!                 shield, and a graft reinstates any link a later burst
//!                 actually needs.
//!
//! PROTOCOL REFINEMENTS over the paper (the lead's brief explicitly grants
//! autonomy to refine):
//!   R1  Sequence-gap healing with a reorder window: `sequence` is a dense
//!       per-sender broadcast counter (wire deviation D3), so a receiver
//!       that holds seq N and N+2 knows N+1 is missing WITHOUT waiting for
//!       an IHAVE. The graft waits out `reorder_window` so in-flight
//!       stragglers quench it — only genuinely lost frames pay the heal.
//!   R2  Graft rotation + bounded retries: each retry targets a different
//!       neighbor (fair round-robin), so a single dead or lossy link cannot
//!       starve a heal. After `graft_max_tries` the id is abandoned
//!       (counted, never re-armed) instead of looping forever.
//!   R3  Graft-serving payload cache: delivered frames keep their raw bytes
//!       in a byte-budgeted FIFO (2 MiB default) so any peer — not just the
//!       original sender — can serve a GRAFT. Track manifests (the largest
//!       gossip frames) stay servable long enough for stragglers.
//!   R4  Origin tail flush: the LAST messages of a burst have no successor
//!       to reveal their gap, and pure-eager links never carry an IHAVE for
//!       them. After `tail_flush_delay` of broadcast silence the origin
//!       re-pushes its last `tail_flush_k` payloads once — a single
//!       one-way trip; holders dedupe, stragglers recover.
//!
//! The engine is a pure state machine: `now` is injected, all effects are
//! returned as [`Action`]s, and the mesh node executes them. That keeps the
//! entire epidemic protocol unit-testable with a synthetic clock and zero
//! sockets (see tests below, plus the 5-node chaos integration test).
